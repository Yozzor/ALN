## Implementation Notes

### Core Features Completed:
1. **Device Detection:** Automatically routes mobile vs desktop users
2. **Session Management:** Persistent localStorage tracking with 10-photo limit
3. **Camera Interface:** Live camera feed with capture/preview/retake flow
4. **Google Drive Integration:** Service account authentication with googleapis library
5. **Responsive Design:** Mobile-first with Tailwind CSS
6. **PWA Ready:** Vite PWA plugin configured for app-like experience

### Google Drive Integration Fixed:
- **Authentication:** Now uses googleapis library with proper JWT service account auth
- **Security:** Service account credentials moved to environment variables (with fallback)
- **Folder Management:** Automatic folder creation and organization
- **Real Upload:** Replaced mock implementation with actual Google Drive API calls
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive error handling and logging

### Technical Architecture:
- **Frontend:** Vite + React + TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with custom primary color scheme
- **State Management:** React hooks with localStorage persistence
- **Camera:** getUserMedia API with mobile-optimized constraints
- **Upload:** Google Drive API v3 with multipart upload
- **PWA:** Service worker and manifest for offline capabilities

### Key Components:
- `App.tsx` - Main router with device detection
- `MobileApp.tsx` - Core mobile app state management
- `CameraInterface.tsx` - Camera capture and preview UI
- `usePhotoSession.ts` - Session persistence and photo counting
- `useGoogleDrive.ts` - OAuth and file upload logic
- `useCamera.ts` - Camera access and photo capture

## Next Steps for Testing:
1. ‚úÖ Fixed Google Drive integration with real API calls
2. ‚úÖ Development server running on HTTP (localhost:5173)
3. üîÑ Test Google Drive upload functionality through browser
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è Camera access will require HTTPS in production
5. üì± Test on mobile device or browser dev tools
6. üöÄ Deploy to production with HTTPS for full functionality

## Deployment Strategy:
1. Build production bundle
2. Deploy to Vercel with custom domain
3. Configure HTTPS for camera access
4. Test on multiple mobile browsers
5. Generate QR codes for easy guest access

## Completed Tasks
- Project initialization and setup
- Core component architecture
- Session management system
- Camera integration
- Google Drive API setup
- UI/UX design implementation
